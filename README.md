College students often struggle with unpredictable schedules, diverse appetites, and limited dining options, leading to significant food wastage in college cafes. This app addresses the issue by allowing students to vote for the next day's menu items, enabling the cafe director to better estimate food quantities needed. Additionally, students can view the current day's offerings. By predicting demand more accurately, the app helps the cafeteria improve inventory management and reduce costs, ultimately minimizing food wastage and enhancing the dining experience for students.
